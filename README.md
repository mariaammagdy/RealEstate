# Real Estate Property Management System with ASP.NET Core

## Objective:
Create a web application for managing real estate properties, tenants, and leases.

## Description:
This project focuses on building a property management system that helps real estate companies manage their properties, tenants, and lease agreements. Property managers can use the system to add new properties, track tenant information, and manage lease terms. Tenants can log in to view their lease details, make rent payments, and report issues with their properties. The system will feature user authentication with role-based access control, ensuring that property managers and tenants have different permissions.

## Technologies to use:
- ASP.NET Core
- MVC
- Entity Framework
- SQL Server
- User Authentication
